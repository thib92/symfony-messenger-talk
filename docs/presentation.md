# About me üë®‚Äçüíª

- French engineering student
- Technical manager @ Junior ISEP

# The challenge

- PHP is a synchronous language
- It's difficult to execute things outside of a request / response context
- Slow running processes directly affect user experience

---

# The challenge

- Call to a 3rd party API
- Big processing after a user interaction
- Sending an email or an SMS
- ...

---

# Quick example

---

# A solution:<br>Asynchronous operations
Aka postponing **("I'll just do it later ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è")**

---

# Quick questions

[.build-lists]

- Who has worked with the Symfony Messenger?
  (side project or production)

# Recap on the Symfony Messenger

![inline](./messenger.png)

---

# It's (small) demo time!

---

# Recap

- Receive an API call
- Send an message through the Symfony Messenger to RabbitMQ
- Respond **now** to the client
- Handle the message later (either with the console or with another service)

---

# The benefits

- Separate the work between different components / services of your application
- Multiple languages in your project
- Asynchronous operations for heavy duty (or long-running processes)

---

# Thanks!
